/// This deliberately does not implement Clone to make it hard to move it out of the handler, which

///
/// The action handler is the heart of a Watchexec program. Within, you decide what happens when an
/// event successfully passes all filters. Watchexec maintains a set of Supervised Commands, which
/// are assigned a [`SupervisorId`] for lightweight reference. In this action handler, you should
/// add commands to be supervised with `create()`, apply [`Outcome`]s to them when they need to
/// change with `apply()`, and `delete()` them when they're not longer needed. While you're
/// encouraged to keep track of the Supervised Commands yourself, the `list()` method also lets you
/// query what commands are currently known to Watchexec.
///
/// Each method that handles supervised commands takes an [`EventSet`] argument, which is used to
/// describe which events led to an action being taken on which command. `EventSet::All` should be
/// the default if you're not sure what to do. This set of events is passed to the `PreSpawn`
/// handler if it is called in response to an action.
///
/// It is important to note that methods called in this handler do not act immediately: rather they
/// build up a list of desired effects which will be applied when the handler returns.
///
/// You are not obliged to use supervised commands: do whatever makes sense for your application.
